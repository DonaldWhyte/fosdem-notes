# FOSDEM Notes

FOSDEM is Europe's largest open-source software development conference. This repository contains notes I wrote during the talks. The notes are split into the different years FOSDEM has been running.

The notes themselves are a bit of a braindump. They have not been tidied up much. Nevertheless, I'm uploading them to GitHub for the purposes of archiving and in case someone does find a use in them.

You can learn more about FOSDEM here: https://fosdem.org/.
